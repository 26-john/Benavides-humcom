    <p>Jollibee is a major Filipino fast-food restaurant chain operated by Jollibee Foods Group (JFC). During 1975, Tony Tan Caktiong started to open a Magnolia ice cream parlor alongside with his families and the store is located in Cubao, Quezon city. Upon demand from consumers, the store later started to offer hot meals and sandwiches. The family agreed to turn the ice cream parlor into a fast food restaurant, which became the first Jollibee outlet in 1978, when food goods became more popular than ice cream. Upon the Rapid development of Jollibee,the business relies on the unique tastes of the Filipino Fast Food industry, which varied from the American fast food business and able to survive upon the arrival of McDonald's in the Philippines in 1981.</p>
