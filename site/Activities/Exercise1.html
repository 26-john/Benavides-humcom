        <p> <u>The Godfather</u> is a crime novel <u>written by Mario Puzo</u>, originally published in 1969 by <u>G. P. Putnam's Sons</u>. 
            It details the story of a <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> fictitious </b> </i> </span> Sicilian Mafia family based in New York City and headed by <u>Don Vito Corleone</u>, who became <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> synonymous </b> </i> </span>
            with the Italian Mafia. The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955, and also provides the back story of <u>Vito Corleone</u> from 
            <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> early </b> </i> </span> childhood to adulthood. The book introduced Italian criminal terms like consigliere, caporegime, Cosa Nostra, and 
            omertà to an English-speaking audience. It formed the basis for a 1972 film of the <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> same </b> </i></span> name. Two film sequels, including 
            <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> new </b> </i> </span> contributions by <u>Puzo</u> himself, were made in 1974 and 1990. The first and second films are widely considered to be two 
            of the <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> greatest </b> </i></span> films of all time. The cover was created by <u>S. Neil Fujita</u> whose design featured a <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> large </b>  </i></span> Gothic-style 
            letter "G" with a <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> long </b>  </i></span> curl at the <span style= 'color: red;'> <i> <b> top </b>  </i></span> emphasizing the first three letters of the title, accompanied by the hands of a 
            puppeteer holding a set of strings over the "father" portion of the word.</p>
